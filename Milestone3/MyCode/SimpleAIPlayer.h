   // deeply to probe. (Note that this means you should evaluate leaf
   // boards directly as they are generated, rather than making a FindBestMove
   // call with level of 0 for each leaf board.  This is important for 
   // efficient running.)  If bk is not 0, it points to a book of previously
   // computed BestMoves, 
   //
   // Postconditions: res->value indicates the result of the minimax search.
   // If res->value <= min or res->value >= max then no "interesting" move
   // could be found, and res->bestMove will indicate the first move where
   // this fact was uncovered.  If brd is an endgame board, then  res->value 
   // will be winVal, 0 or -winVal, and res->bestMove will be 0 since there 
   // is no move from an endgame position.  Otherwise, res->bestMove will 
   // provide the best move.  
   // 
   // Res->numBoards gives the number of boards examined during the
   // minimax computation, including the root board. *brd is left in the same
   // state as it was when the call commenced.  Res->value gives the
   // minimax computed value for *brd. *tt will contain new entries for any board 
   // configurations that were computed during the call, with depth greater than or 
   // equal to SAVE_LEVEL (currently 1), and will have updated any entries for 
   // which deeper results were computed during the call.
