   // deeply to probe. (Note that this means you should evaluate leaf

   // was uncovered.  If brd is an endgame board, then  res->value will
   // be winVal, 0 or -winVal, and res->bestMove will be 0 since there is no move
   // from an endgame position.  Otherwise, res->bestMove will provide the best
   // move.  Res->numBoards gives the number of boards examined during the
   // minimax computation, including the root board. *brd is left in the same
   // state as it was when the call commenced.  Res->value gives the
   // minimax computed value for *brd. *bk will contain new entries for any board 
   // configurations that were computed during the call, with depth greater than or
